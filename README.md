# FoodMenuIntent
This app is a Food Menu.

It dislays a menu of dishes in a grid view with each dish in a material card view.

Each card contains an image, a title and a price of the dishes on the menu.

When any card or dish is clicked or selected, the app takes you to another screen.

This screen contains more details about each menu so as to know what you're ordering.

For this to be possible, i used a recyclerView and an explicit intent to display
the dishes on the menu and move from one the first screen to the second respectively...
